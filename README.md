### version 1.0.0
Simple msuic app with animations

## Contributors
The project was developed by Justine Kenyansa.

## :flashlight: Description
<br>
The app allows you to play music, move to the next item seamlessly. <br> Currently, it has several limitations such as adding your own files.<br>
The song duration is displayed for each song and the current time while playing. 

## :pushpin: Installation Requirements
The app does not need any installations to work.
## Known Bugs
<br>
1. The display of total time for each song sometimes doesn't display corrently.<br>
2. The toggle functionality for play and pause (icons) is yet to be improved
3. Sometimes, you have to click twice for the song to start playing.<br>
These limitaitons will be addresses shortly.

## :pushpin: BDD
You simply click the play button and the songs start playing. It is expected that the playlist should run to the very last item continuously if not paused. <br> On pressing the pause/play button, the song stops playing. <br>
Forward and backward buttons are also working very well. <br>
The slider bar is also working as expected. The song jumps to the min and second and desired.

## :computer: Technologies Used
 The project used HTML, css, and Vanilla JS.
